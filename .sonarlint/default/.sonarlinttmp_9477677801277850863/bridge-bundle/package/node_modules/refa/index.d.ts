/**
 * A character base is constructed from a collection of character sets. It holds a list of disjoint, non-empty
 * character sets - the base sets - that can be used to construct every character set in the collection it was
 * constructed from.
 *
 * ## Guarantees
 *
 * - The base sets are guaranteed to be mutually disjoint and non-empty.
 *
 * - Every character set in the collection can be constructed by combining (union) a unique set of base sets.
 *
 * - The list of base sets is guaranteed to be as small as possible. There are at most `min(n^2, o)` base sets where `n`
 *   is the number of unique, non-empty character sets in the collection, and `o` is the number of characters in the
 *   union of all character sets in the collection.
 *
 * ## Use case
 *
 * The primary purpose of base sets is to remap alphabets. Some FA operations scale with the number of characters in the
 * alphabet of the FA (e.g. DFA minimization).
 *
 * Base sets can be used to determine which characters in an FA's alphabet *Σ* cannot be distinguished by the FA *A*.
 * Two characters *a,b* in *Σ* are indistinguishable if for all inputs *w* the following hold true:
 *
 * 1. *w* is accepted by *A* iff *w* with all occurrences of *a* replaced with *b* is accepted by *A*.
 * 2. *w* is accepted by *A* iff *w* with all occurrences of *b* replaced with *a* is accepted by *A*.
 *
 * Two indistinguishable characters are guaranteed to be in the same base set.
 *
 * By treating each base set as a character, it is possible to create a new (smaller) alphabet *Γ* (*|Γ| <= |Σ|*) such
 * that the FA *A* still behaves the same.
 *
 * Since *Γ* is typically (several orders of magnitude) smaller, operations that scale with the size of the alphabet
 * can be done more quickly.
